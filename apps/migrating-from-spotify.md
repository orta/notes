# Migrating from Spotify

Spotify is in the news for [their deal with Joe Rogan](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22915456/spotify-ceo-joe-rogan-daniel-ek-town-hall-speech-platform-podcast), it feels like about once a year I've thought of migrating away from Spotify but never quite figured out an solid solution. I figured maybe I should get around to it this time.

### How I use Spotify

- I have music on almost all the time. It tends to be the same set of playlists and people. Mostly matched to mood.
- I have a family account which 2 other people use.
- I enjoy the Discover weekly and Release Radar auto-playlists.
- The desktop app has been a pretty consistent experience for the last 12 years.
- I don't use a phone, so mobile experience is 

My musical taste is pretty flexible, [it's mostly Punk with some Pop-Punk and some weird experimental metal](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/00vgjOug9CRCcrOBVTIK6o?si=3a018112727a4195).

### All Options

I think this table is a good overview of [every possible option](https://soundiiz.com/features). Realistically I'm not going to go through everything here.

### Streaming Options

- Apple Music. Probably the biggest direct competitor, and I did give it a test run a year or two ago, but I'm trying to not give money to monopolies and I think chasing subscriptions is ruining / ruined Apple.

- Amazon Music. Monopolies.

- Deezer. A good option for staying in the music streaming world. Has similar features like recommendations and family plans, it is a bit more expensive, but not offensively. They also went in on podcasts and audiobooks, which probably means I'd just be holding off fir a few more years.

- TIDAL. Bought by a blockchain company, so that's a big nope. Not putting money towards the big grift.

- Napster. Owned by BestBuy? It could just be a simple plain service. If one of the most interesting options falls though, this might be viable. Seems to have a lot of the music I listen to on.

- SoundCloud Go+. Tempting, SoundCloud have a good reputation with artists, and I'd take a convenience hit for that. [They're trying new things](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309090/soundcloud-artist-stream-pay-listener-fan-royalties). When I sent over 200 songs from Spotify to SoundCloud, 184 were available under Go+. Looks like some third party apps seem good

- YouTube Music. Possible actually, I know I want to avoid giving money to monopolies, but I do watch a bunch of YouTube and removing ads (on the Apple TV) is a good side-effect. Looks like one or two desktop apps.

### Back to Files?

I like music streaming, but the core thing is that I mostly listen to the same stuff and (with the exception of music so far) prefer to own something over rent. 

- Bandcamp. I'm largely uninterested in the social aspects of bandcamp. [My band uses it](https://kieronononon.bandcamp.com). 

- Torrents. I mean, I don't think I'd feel too guilty grabbing some of the albums I've bought on vinyl before, or ordered merch from but it's not a long-term sustainable model. 

### General Plans

I think I'll try SoundCloud Go+ for the trial (ergh, got to give a card ahead of time though) to have a sense if that work. 
If not then I think I'm going back to downloading files and abandoning my wife + others to either Spotify ads or drag them to soundcloud.
